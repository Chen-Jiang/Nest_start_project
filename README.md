This is the MVP of my application. </n>
When you mouse over a district of New Zealand, you can see the crime data of this district from 2019 to 2020.
Different color represents different seriousness of the crime situation. The darker, the more crimes, red has more crimes than blues. We can clearly see Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Hamilton has much more crimes than any other districts(due to the large area).
TEST

Here is the demo to show how the simple application looks like:
